title: "Protoss vs Zerg | Chargelot-DT vs 6000MMR"
excerpt: "In today's Starcraft 2 lesson we go through a protoss vs zerg game against a very strong grandmaster \"Ryu\" who is currently about 6000MMR on the north american server. I play a pretty unique 4 gate zealot-dt style which is very close to Zest's 4 gate adept build that is running rampant on the ladder."
