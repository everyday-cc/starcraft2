title: "Fans Want Xbox To Bring Back StarCraft, But Phil Spencer Wants MechAssault"
excerpt: "MechWarrior is an interesting choice from Phil, but something of a licensing nightmare. The franchise really starts with Battletech, a wargaming board game published and created by FASA Corporation. MechWarrior is a spinoff of Battletech, and it is an RPG board game where you play a mech pilot."
