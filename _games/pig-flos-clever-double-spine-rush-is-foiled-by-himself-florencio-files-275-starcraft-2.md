title: "Flo's clever double spine rush is foiled by... himself | Florencio Files #275 - StarCraft 2"
excerpt: "I cast one of the mysterious and deranged StarCraft 2 builds of the one and only, Florencio, the dude that invented the Protoss proxy nexus recall rush. In this episode, the Sewer Mermaid has a very good strat that deals a lot of damage. But is it enough against such a good opponent?  ðŸ§œFlorencio Files"
