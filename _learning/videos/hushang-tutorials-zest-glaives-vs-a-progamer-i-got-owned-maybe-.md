title: "Zest Glaives vs a PROGAMER?! I got OWNED... maybe ;)"
excerpt: "Zest Glaives vs a PROGAMER?! I got OWNED... maybe... In this Starcraft 2 guide we take a look at an example replay of the build we learned yesterday! I had a hard time finding a good opponent to show you guys an example but after dieing to cannon rushes many time, I found one: previous progamer golden."
