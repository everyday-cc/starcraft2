title: "Bring Snacks. This Match between Cure and Classic is AWESOME! (StarCraft 2)"
excerpt: "One of the best games of StarCraft 2 this year. Cure vs Classic from Gamers8. Both pro gamers try to end this SC2 match as quickly as possible by  being in the opponents face the entire time, but neither of them gets the job done in the early game. A chaotic game with multiple base races ensues. Support"
