title: "StarCraft 2: VOID RAYS ARE... GOOD?! (DRG vs Cyan)"
excerpt: "Void Rays are making a comeback in professional StarCraft 2. In this match of Protoss versus Zerg I focus a lot on what Cyan is playing. He decides to go for Void Rays very early on, and does so in a very clever way. I also discuss the potential responses that the Zerg can go for, and why certain moves"
