title: "StarCraft 2: Can Maru/Byun fend off the NA Clowns in an EPIC 2v2? | PiG Reacts"
excerpt: "I was going to cast this as an FPV vid, but listening and reacting to Special+Astrea playing 2v2 against Maru+Byun was just too funny. Great match, great reactions from Special, really fun series. This best of 5 series was played as a precursor to Nation Wars 2022.  Follow Special on Twitch! https://www.twitch.tv/special_"
