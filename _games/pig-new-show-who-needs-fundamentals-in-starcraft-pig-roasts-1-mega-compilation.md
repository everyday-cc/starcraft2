title: "*New Show* WHO NEEDS FUNDAMENTALS IN STARCRAFT?! | PiG Roasts #1 (mega compilation)"
excerpt: "Here's a new show I finally got to do during the subathon: PiG Roasts! where I roast the ever living sh*t out of people's replays. All in good fun, of course! There were replays in both lower and higher leagues, with some questionable strategies and mechanics no matter what. Hope you guys enjoy :P  ðŸ”¥"
