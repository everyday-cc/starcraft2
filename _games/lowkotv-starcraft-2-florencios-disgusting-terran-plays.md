title: "StarCraft 2: FLORENCIO'S DISGUSTING TERRAN PLAYS!"
excerpt: "I've casted quite a few of Florencio's Protoss games in StarCraft 2. This time around he's showing some of the strategies that he is working on with Terran. In this game he opens up with a Reaper Bunker rush, then transitions towards Battlecruisers and eventually leads to Mech and quadruple Nukes.  Florencio"
