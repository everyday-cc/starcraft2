title: "Climbing the ladder | High Grandmaster Protoss plays vs 4400-4800 players"
excerpt: "Live high-level protoss ladder play. Unfortunately the footage came out quite choppy at some points and I was considering just not posting today, but I will post it anyways in case a few of you want to watch still. I'm trying to figure out what the cause of the lag is and hopefully I can get some cleaner"
