title: "How quickly can REYNOR dispose of noobs? (Part 2) | Holdout Challenge - StarCraft 2"
excerpt: "In part 2, the noobs are actually Grandmaster players but since they're not pros they're still considered noobs to Reynor.  We paid Reynor to 1v1 noobs in StarCraft 2. The challenge: the noobs needed to stay in the match for as long as possible. How did they fare against an actual Zerg Championship player?"
