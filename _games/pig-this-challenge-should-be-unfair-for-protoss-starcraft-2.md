title: "This challenge should be unfair for Protoss - StarCraft 2"
excerpt: "Rule: you can only take the two gases in your main! I hosted this tournament during Subathon 2.0 and we had a lot of Terran and Protoss players take part. You would think that MAN WITH GUN wins this but is Neeb a god? Neeb vs BattleB | Low Gas Tournament (Bo5 PvT) -- üê∑ Second Channel for Learning StarCraft"
