excerpt: "There's a reason why anytime I host a showmatch, I ALWAYS invite Astrea - He is just TOO fun to watch. This game is from a pro tournament, where Astrea has been goofing off the entire time and winning with gigabrained mind games. He sent me this personally, saying this was the most interesting match"
