title: "CHEESEDOWN #2 - Noregret vs Has G3-6 + Interview"
excerpt: "In their first series Noregret narrowly triumphed over the taiwanese player. Now Has will have to unholster every cannon and proxy dark shrine in his arsenal to bring it back and fight for the title. Iâ€™m also bloody curious to see if chronoboost makes up for the lack of a MSC when a match is full on"
