I would highly suggest all Zerg players to try out this build order at least once versus a Terran that is going for a standard Reaper Expand or CC first. This build order is great versus Terran in the current metagame.","sourceUrl":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/starcraft2/api/learning/videos/lowkotv-zerg-build-order-roros-roach-baneling-timing-push-versus-terran-starcraft-2-heart-of-the-swarm/index.json","webUrl":"https://everyday.cc/starcraft2/learning/videos/lowkotv-zerg-build-order-roros-roach-baneling-timing-push-versus-terran-starcraft-2-heart-of-the-swarm/","originalUrl":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=sq7Yj3kSm5Y","featuredContent":"<iframe width=\"800\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sq7Yj3kSm5Y\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","actions":null,"length":"PT4M54S","ratings":null,"provider":{"name":"LowkoTV","domain":"lowko.tv","images":[{"url":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/starcraft2/assets/images/organizations/lowko.tv-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"publishers":null,"authors":null},"publishedDateTime":"2013-06-08T13:46:29Z","levels":null,"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":50,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sq7Yj3kSm5Y/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":true}],"content":"","type":"video","price":"Free","topics":["StarCraft 2","Terran","Zerg"]}
