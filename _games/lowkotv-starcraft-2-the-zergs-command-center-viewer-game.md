excerpt: "A viewer submitted game of StarCraft 2 where the Zerg manages to win the game two minutes in, but for some reason doesn't go in for the kill. He decides to sit around and toy with his opponents units untill he can make his own Terran army using the Infestor and Neural Parasite.  Support my work on Patreon:"
