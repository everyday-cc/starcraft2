excerpt: "Welcome to the new Terran ladder series! This time, it's \"Never Attack to Grandmaster!\" In this challenge, I play as Terran on the EU ladder, and in every game I'm not allowed to attack with any units except for using Ghosts. I'm allowed to make any army units for defending, as long as I don't attack"
