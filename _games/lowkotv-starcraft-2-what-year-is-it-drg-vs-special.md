title: "StarCraft 2: WHAT YEAR IS IT?! (DRG vs SpeCial)"
excerpt: "Muta Ling Bane was a popular style in the early days of StarCraft 2. Yet over the year the style kind of fell off. The reason is that Terran players got much better, maps are bigger and most importantly new units got added. In this Terran versus Zerg between SpeCial and DRG, DRG plays like it's either"
