title: "How to beat the 1v7 INSANE AI Challenge #2 - StarCraft 2"
excerpt: "I have challenged StarCraft 2 Pros to take on 7 Random INSANE Cheater AIs at once! Serral has said it is impossible unless maybe they're all Zergs. After Spirit (Soul) tried it first, the next person brave enough to try it is PiLiPiLi, a Protoss player. He took on 7 Random insane AIs all on Any Build."
