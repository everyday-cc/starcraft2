title: "StarCraft 2 - These are the Terran units to worry about | Diamond in the Ruff #54"
excerpt: "I cast a StarCraft 2 game from Ruff, a Terran with very creative gameplay. How will he ruff up his Protoss opponent? There are battlecruisers in this match, but it's ghost banshees that are soooo destructive - fragile but the DPS is ridiculous! üê∑ Support PiG: https://www.patreon.com/PiGSC2  Check out"
